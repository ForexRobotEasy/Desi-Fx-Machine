Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We only provide this sample code that can work as described in the product. To find the official developer of this product, please use MQL5.

## How It Works

The code is written in MQL5, which is a language specifically designed for developing trading robots and technical indicators in the MetaTrader 5 platform.

The EA has three main functions: `OnInit()`, `OnTick()`, and `OnDeinit()`. 

In the `OnInit()` function, the desired currency pairs are set using the `string[] currencyPairs` array. The EA then opens a chart for each currency pair and attaches itself to the chart using the `AttachEA()` function.

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the market. It checks if the current chart is attached to the EA, and if so, it calls the `MarketConditionsMet()` function to evaluate the market conditions and indicators. If the conditions are met, the `PlacePendingOrders()` function is called to place pending orders.

The `MarketConditionsMet()` function is where you can implement your own market condition evaluation logic. For this example, it always returns true.

The `PlacePendingOrders()` function is responsible for placing the pending orders. It calculates the price, stop loss, and take profit levels based on the input parameters. It then calls the `OrderSend()` function to place the orders.

The `IsExpertEnabled()` function checks if the EA is enabled for the current chart. It returns true if the EA is enabled, and false otherwise.

The `AttachEA()` function attaches the EA to the current chart. It creates an expert handle using `ExpertCreate()` and sets the expert properties. Finally, it enables the expert advisor using `ExpertEnable()`.

The `CloseAllOrders()` function is used to close all orders on the chart. It loops through all the orders and checks if they belong to the specified symbol. It then calls the `OrderClose()` function to close the orders.

Please note that this is a simplified version of an EA and may require further customization and optimization based on your trading strategy and preferences.
